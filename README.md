# DIVA_PyTorch
Implementation of the DIVA model of speech acquisition and production using pytorch

DIVA is a popular computational model based on neural networks for better understanding the processes of human speech acquisition and production. The publicly available implementation of DIVA was originally done in Matlab. Recently, neural networks have become increasingly more popular, with new open-source frameworks available to researchers for development. As Matlab is rarely used in this context, we propose to extend the usability of DIVA by implementing it in the Python machine learning framework, PyTorch. This repository contains the source code for TorchDIVA, a fully functional recreation of the original DIVA model.
